----- HTML

** Referencing image file paths in src/template.html?
    - run : npm install --save-dev html-loader
    - include this in modules.rules array in webpack.common.js:
{
    test: /\.html$/i,
    loader: "html-loader",
}

----- JS

** Referencing image file paths in js with imports?
    - include this in modules.rules array in webpack.common.js:
{
  test: /\.(png|svg|jpg|jpeg|gif)$/i,
  type: "asset/resource",
}
    - then wherever you want to import that image, do this
import odinImage from "./odin.png";
   
const image = document.createElement("img");
image.src = odinImage;

** Need to transpile code so that older browsers can understand it, or so you can use new features not yet supported by browsers?
